# ðŸ“” Welcome to my Automation Use Cases

> **This repository contains some of the use cases I worked on in my automation side business and thought were documentation worthy. It's mainly intended for learning purposes and to strengthen the habit of writing down the things I get done, below is a summary of my reasons:**
>
> - Personal learning and reference
> - Documentation of technical and/or challenging approaches
> - Sharing knowledge without exposing proprietary code
> - Making sure the knowledge i absorbed is ingrained in my brain
